## McDonalds' India user-friendly item selector
This Program lets the user know everything about what they are about to consume.
The data was scraped from the official McDonalds' India website, which includes all the menu items, along with their nutritional value.
The user is permitted to choose what menu they want to order from, and then they select their preferred nutrient.
The output shows 5 Items of the menu selected with the highest concentration of the selected nutrient, and 5 items with the lowest concentration.
After getting to know that, we let the user get more information, including per serve size, price, and all the other nutrients.
This can be very helpful in encouraging the people to eat what is good for their body, while getting the taste of "Outside food"/
